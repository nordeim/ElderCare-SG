## üí° Vision & Mission

We envision a digital experience that:

- Communicates warmth, reliability, and clinical trustworthiness.
- Helps adult children confidently book care services for their aging parents.
- Brings accessibility and performance best practices into eldercare.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is designed to run in a Docker container, managed by a simple `Makefile`.

### Recommended Workflow (Docker)

This is the simplest and most reliable way to get the application running.

The application will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

### Alternative Workflow (Local Environment)

If you have a local PHP 8.3 and Node.js 22 environment, you can run the application manually.

1.  **Clone and set up the environment:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nordeim/ElderCare-SG.git
    cd ElderCare-SG
    cp .env.example .env
    composer install
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Configure your `.env` file** with your local database and Redis credentials.

3.  **Run key commands and start the servers:**
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    php artisan migrate
    npm run build
    php artisan serve
    ```

---

### Production Deployments (Docker Compose)

For containerized production releases:

1. Populate secrets in `.env.production` (APP_KEY, database credentials, Plausible keys, etc.).
2. Build assets locally or in CI so `public/` contains the hashed bundles (`npm run build`).
3. Run the production stack:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose-production.yml up -d
   ```
   This launches PHP-FPM (`app`), Nginx (`nginx`), and supporting services using `.env.production`. Static assets are mounted read-only into both containers, and health checks monitor `/healthz`.

> **Note:** `docker-compose-production.yml` is intended for parity environments. Inject secrets via your CI/CD pipeline rather than committing them to Git.

## üß™ Quality Assurance & Testing

### Automated Test Suite
- **PHPUnit (Phase 6 focus)**: `php artisan test --group=phase6` covers Mailchimp retries, booking analytics, and resource hub CTA fallbacks (`tests/Feature/*`).
- **Vitest**: `npm run test:js` validates Alpine stores and analytics dispatch logic.
- **Playwright smoke (manual)**: `npm run test:playwright:ci` is available for targeted analytics verification across estimator, FAQ, resources, and prompts (`tests/analytics.spec.ts`).
- **Accessibility audit**: `npm run lint:accessibility` runs axe-core against the dev server via `concurrently`.
- **Lighthouse CI**: `npm run lighthouse:ci` executes the configuration in `lighthouserc.json`; artifacts saved to `storage/app/lighthouse/`.

### Continuous Integration
`qa-ci.yml` orchestrates the core QA suite on every push/PR (PHP 8.3 + Node 22): composer/npm installs, grouped PHPUnit tests, axe CLI, Lighthouse CI, and artifact upload.

### Manual QA & Accessibility Standards
- Follows WCAG 2.1 AA; checklists documented in `docs/qa/scaffold-checklist.md` and `docs/ops/validation_checklist.md`.
- `docs/qa/launch-checklist.md` captures launch gating tasks (analytics verification, backups, rollback plan).
- Known performance warnings (FCP/LCP/CLS) tracked in `docs/notes/performance-2025-10-01.md` as backlog work.
