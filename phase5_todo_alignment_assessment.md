# Phase 5 To-Do Plan Alignment Assessment

**Date:** 2025-10-02
**Source Documents:**
1.  `docs/plans/master_todo_roadmap.md`
2.  `docs/todo/phase5_design_system_subplan.md`

## 1. Executive Summary

This report assesses the alignment between the high-level **Phase 5** objectives defined in the master roadmap and the detailed tasks outlined in the Phase 5 sub-plan.

The analysis concludes that the `phase5_design_system_subplan.md` is in **excellent alignment** with the `master_todo_roadmap.md`. The sub-plan correctly interprets the strategic goals of Phase 5 and translates them into a comprehensive, actionable, and well-structured set of workstreams. It provides the necessary granularity for a development team to execute the work while adhering to the project's quality and documentation standards.

## 2. Objective and Scope Alignment Analysis

This section compares the key implementation steps from the master roadmap with the corresponding workstreams in the sub-plan.

| Roadmap Implementation Step | Sub-Plan Workstream / Checklist | Alignment Assessment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Semantic Tokens:** Refactor `tailwind.config.js` to expose `--color-trust`, `--color-warmth`, etc., and map to CSS variables. | **1. Semantic Color Tokens:** Provides a detailed checklist for defining CSS variables, mapping them in `tailwind.config.js`, and updating key components. | ✅ **Direct Alignment** |
| **Fluid Typography:** Introduce `clamp()` utilities for headings/body text via Tailwind plugin or custom utilities. | **2. Fluid Typography Utilities:** Details the implementation via a plugin or theme extension, application to components, and validation steps. | ✅ **Direct Alignment** |
| **Component Catalog:** Author `docs/components.md` describing props, slots, accessibility notes, and example usage. | **3. Component Catalog Documentation:** Outlines the structure of the new `docs/components.md` file and specifies the exact components to be documented. | ✅ **Direct Alignment** |
| **Storybook Alternative:** Consider Blade playground route (`/ui-kit`) restricted to local env for rapid QA. | **4. Optional UI Playground (`/ui-kit`):** Translates the "consideration" into a concrete, optional implementation plan with specific file paths and technical requirements. | ✅ **Direct Alignment** |

## 3. Completeness and Quality Assessment

*   **Granularity:** The sub-plan successfully breaks down the high-level goals into specific, verifiable tasks. The use of checklists for each workstream makes progress easy to track.
*   **Risk Management:** The sub-plan includes a "Risks & Mitigations" section that addresses potential issues like visual regressions and documentation drift, demonstrating proactive planning.
*   **Validation:** The sub-plan defines clear "Validation & Testing" steps and "Exit Criteria," ensuring that the work can be formally verified upon completion. This aligns with the "Definition of Done" principle from the master roadmap.
*   **Clarity:** The plan is well-written, easy to understand, and provides specific file paths and code examples, reducing ambiguity for developers.

## 4. Conclusion

The `phase5_design_system_subplan.md` is a high-quality planning document that is fully aligned with the strategic objectives for Phase 5 as laid out in the `master_todo_roadmap.md`. It provides the necessary detail and structure to guide a successful implementation. No misalignments or gaps were identified.
