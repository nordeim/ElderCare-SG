All key deliverables outlined in the research brief have been produced and are present in the current codebase. The project is well-prepared for the implementation phases that follow.

## 2. Deliverable Validation

The `phase0_alignment_research_brief.md` document outlined several key deliverables and a "Next Steps Checklist". This assessment validates their status.

## 3. Overall Assessment

Phase 0 was executed correctly according to its plan. The documented outputs provide the necessary clarity on UX flows, data requirements, and content needs to proceed with implementation. The pending "Next Steps" are external coordination tasks that do not block the commencement of subsequent development phases, as evidenced by the progress already made on Phases 2, 3, and 4.

**Conclusion:** Phase 0 is complete and its objectives have been met.
