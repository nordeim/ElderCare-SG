# Phase 1 Status Analysis and Assessment

**Date:** 2025-10-02
**Source Document:** `docs/plans/phase1_assessment_implementation_plan.md`

## 1. Executive Summary

This report assesses the completion status of **Phase 1 – Guided Needs Assessment**. The analysis concludes that this phase is **planned but not yet implemented**.

The implementation plan is comprehensive and provides a clear blueprint for developers. It details the required new components, services, routes, and tests. However, a validation of the codebase confirms that these artifacts have not yet been created. This aligns perfectly with the `master_todo_roadmap.md`, which indicates that work on Phase 1 has not commenced.

## 2. Artifact Validation

The `phase1_assessment_implementation_plan.md` document specifies the creation of several new files. This assessment validates their absence from the current codebase, confirming the phase is pending.

| Planned Artifact | Expected Location | Validation Finding | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Assessment Component | `resources/views/components/assessment.blade.php` | File does not exist. | ❌ **Pending** |
| Alpine Store | `resources/js/modules/assessment.js` | File does not exist. | ❌ **Pending** |
| Assessment Service | `app/Services/AssessmentService.php` | File does not exist. | ❌ **Pending** |
| Assessment Controller | `app/Http/Controllers/AssessmentController.php` | File does not exist. | ❌ **Pending** |
| Assessment Request | `app/Http/Requests/AssessmentSubmissionRequest.php` | File does not exist. | ❌ **Pending** |
| Localization Files | `resources/lang/en/assessment.php` | File does not exist. | ❌ **Pending** |
| Feature Test | `tests/Feature/AssessmentSubmissionTest.php` | File does not exist. | ❌ **Pending** |
| Unit Test | `tests/Unit/AssessmentServiceTest.php` | File does not exist. | ❌ **Pending** |

## 3. Overall Assessment

Phase 1 is in a well-defined, ready-for-development state. The implementation plan is thorough and aligns with the project's established architecture. The absence of the specified files is not a deviation from the plan but rather a confirmation of the project's current position in the roadmap.

**Conclusion:** The plan for Phase 1 is complete. The implementation is pending and is the next major user-facing feature to be developed.
