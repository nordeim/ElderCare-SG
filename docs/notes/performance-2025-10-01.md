# Performance Optimization Log â€” 2025-10-01

## Current Metrics
- Performance score: 0.68 (latest Lighthouse run)
- First Contentful Paint: 2.70s
- Largest Contentful Paint: 3.03s
- Time to Interactive: 3.93s
- Speed Index: 3.35s
- Max Potential FID: 20ms
- Main-thread work: Style/Layout 1.81s, Script Evaluation 0.53s

## Optimizations Completed
- Added `content-visibility-auto` to `#programs`, `#philosophy`, `#testimonials`, and `#booking` sections in `resources/views/home.blade.php` to defer layout/paint for offscreen content.
- Implemented `resources/js/modules/hero.js` to lazy-load and pause hero video based on viewport intersection.
- Added hero fallbacks to avoid missing asset console errors in `resources/views/components/hero.blade.php` and `resources/views/components/virtual-tour.blade.php`.

## Outstanding Work
- Investigate residual Style/Layout cost ~1.8s (possible DOM complexity in `#programs` grid and cost estimator modal).
- Defer non-critical Alpine stores or convert to `requestIdleCallback` for analytics module.
- Configure server caching and compression to eliminate `uses-long-cache-ttl` and `uses-text-compression` warnings.
- Profile MPFID outliers to ensure no long tasks >50ms remain.
