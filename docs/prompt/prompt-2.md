@docs/plans/scafolding\ plan.md @docs/plans/master_todo_roadmap.md the codebase was first built with `scafolding plan.md`, then remediated using the `master_to_roadmap.md`. according to project status update Phase 0 to 4 in the `master_todo_roadmap.md`. now meticulously review these plan/roadmap documents to expect the actual codebase should be like, then meticulously validate your expectation of the codebase against the actual codebase in the current project folder. then think deeper and think harder to meticulously plan how to document down your review findings and assessment of the current project status as a comprehensive `codebase_review_and_analysis_assessment.md` report in markdown format.

please meticulously review @docs/plans/phase0_alignment_research_brief.md @docs/plans/phase1_assessment_implementation_plan.md @docs/todo/phase3_virtual_tour_plan.md @docs/todo/phase4_decision_support_plan.md one by one from phase0 to phase4 plan/status documents, validate each one against the current actual codebase and capture your assessment of each plan/status document as `phase0_status_analysis_assessment.md` report, create individual report up to `phase4_status_analysis_assessment.md`. Then with your deep understanding of the current state of the project codebase, update the agent document @CLAUDE.md. this is an important validation task, so plan meticulously how you will approach it first before proceeding cautious.
