## Architecture

**Pattern:** MVC with Service Layer
- Controllers (`app/Http/Controllers`) handle HTTP requests
- Models (`app/Models`) interact with database via Eloquent
- Services (`app/Services`) contain business logic and integrations
- Form Requests (`app/Http/Requests`) validate incoming data

**Key Directories:**
```
app/
â”œâ”€â”€ Http/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Controllers/     # Request handling
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Requests/        # Form validation
â”œâ”€â”€ Models/              # Eloquent models
â”œâ”€â”€ Services/            # Business logic
â””â”€â”€ Providers/           # Service providers

resources/
â”œâ”€â”€ views/               # Blade templates
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/      # Reusable components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ layouts/         # Page layouts
â””â”€â”€ js/                  # Alpine.js modules

database/
â”œâ”€â”€ migrations/          # Schema definitions
â””â”€â”€ seeders/             # Sample data
```

- âœ… Keyboard navigability for all components
- âœ… Screen reader accessibility
- âœ… Reduced motion support
- âœ… Focus management

**Lighthouse Targets:**

## Core Features Implementation

### 1. Homepage
- Hero section with dual CTAs and a "live" availability snapshot.
- Active programs display pulled from the database.
- Testimonials carousel (interactive).
- Newsletter subscription form.

### 2. Virtual Tour
- Interactive modal experience with hotspots.
- Data source: `resources/data/tour_hotspots.json`.
- Dynamic staff carousel populated from the `staff` table.
- Alpine.js for state management and analytics event tracking.

### 3. Decision Support Tools
- âœ… **Cost Estimator:** A fully implemented interactive tool for estimating monthly fees.
- âœ… **FAQ System:** An accessible accordion with live search/filter functionality.
- âœ… **Resource Hub:** A section for users to download caregiver guides.
- ðŸ”„ **Needs Assessment:** (Planned) An interactive questionnaire to provide personalized recommendations.

### 4. Newsletter System
- Mailchimp API integration via `MailchimpService`.
- Server-side validation using a Form Request.
- Session-based success/error flash messaging.

## Testing Strategy

**Test Types:**
- **PHPUnit:** For backend unit and feature tests.
- **Vitest:** For JavaScript and Alpine.js component tests.
- **Playwright:** For end-to-end browser and visual regression testing.
- **axe-core:** For automated accessibility checks, run via npm scripts.

**Running Tests:**
```bash
# Full PHPUnit test suite
make test

# Specific PHPUnit test file
make artisan ARGS="test tests/Feature/HomePageTest.php"

# Run all JavaScript tests
make npm-test-js
```

## Development Guidelines

**Code Organization:**
- Controllers should be thin and delegate logic to services.
- All significant business logic belongs in `app/Services`.
- Use Form Requests for all incoming data validation.
- Build all reusable UI elements as Blade components.

**Naming Conventions:**
- Models: `Program` (PascalCase)
- Controllers: `HomeController` (PascalCase + "Controller")
- Services: `MailchimpService` (PascalCase + "Service")
- Views: `virtual-tour.blade.php` (kebab-case)

**Database Conventions:**
- Table names: `testimonials` (plural, snake_case)
- Foreign keys: `user_id` (singular + _id)
- Timestamps: `created_at`, `updated_at`

## Common Implementation Patterns

### Creating a New Feature
1.  Create migration: `make artisan ARGS="make:migration create_feature_table"`
2.  Create model & seeder: `make artisan ARGS="make:model Feature -s"`
3.  Create controller: `make artisan ARGS="make:controller FeatureController"`
4.  Create service (if needed): `app/Services/FeatureService.php`
5.  Create views: `resources/views/feature/`
6.  Add routes: `routes/web.php`
7.  Add tests and run `make test`

### Adding a New Blade Component
1.  Create file: `resources/views/components/component-name.blade.php`
2.  Use in templates: `<x-component-name />`
3.  Document props using `@props` in the component file.

### Frontend Interactivity
1.  Create an Alpine.js module in `resources/js/modules/`.
2.  Import and register it in `resources/js/app.js`.
3.  Add the `x-data` directive to your Blade component.
4.  Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard navigable.

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
- **Container won't start:** Check `docker-compose.yml` and `.env.docker`.
- **Assets not updating:** Run `make npm-build` or `make npm-dev`.
- **Database errors / Missing data:** Run `make migrate-fresh` to reset and seed the database.
- **Permission issues:** Check file ownership inside the container (`ls -la storage`).

**Debug Commands:**
```bash
# Check container logs
make logs

# Enter container for debugging
make bash

# Check Laravel routes
make artisan ARGS="route:list"

# Clear all application caches
make artisan ARGS="cache:clear && config:clear && view:clear && route:clear"
```

## Project Status & Roadmap

**Current Status:**
- âœ… **Phase 2 (Availability), 3 (Virtual Tour), & 4 (Decision Support) are implemented.**
- âœ… **Phase 5 (Design System) technical work is complete.**
- The application has a feature-rich, interactive frontend.
- The core backend services for existing features are in place.

**Upcoming Milestones (in order):**
- **Phase 1 (Guided Needs Assessment):** Implement the interactive questionnaire.
- **Phase 5 (Docs):** Complete the component documentation.
- **Phase 7 (QA Automation):** Implement GitHub Actions for automated testing and linting.
- **Phase 6 (Data Hardening):** Expand seeders and harden integrations.

## Security Measures
- **Input Validation:** All incoming data is validated via dedicated Form Request classes.
- **CSRF Protection:** Laravel's built-in CSRF protection is enabled on all web routes.
- **SQL Injection Prevention:** The use of the Eloquent ORM and parameterized queries prevents SQL injection.
- **XSS Protection:** Blade's `{{ }}` syntax automatically escapes output to prevent Cross-Site Scripting.
- **Environment Variables:** Sensitive keys and configuration are stored in `.env` files and are not committed to version control.

## Current Optimizations
- **Asset Bundling:** All CSS and JS are compiled and minified for production using Vite.
- **Caching:** Redis is used to cache frequently accessed data, such as the results from the `AvailabilityService`.
- **Database Performance:** Eloquent queries are optimized with eager loading (`with()`) where appropriate to prevent N+1 problems.
- **Lazy Loading:** Media assets in components like the virtual tour are lazy-loaded to improve initial page load times.
